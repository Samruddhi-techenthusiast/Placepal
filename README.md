# PlacePal – Personal Placement Companion

## Problem Statement
In many colleges, placement platforms are centrally managed and students face multiple challenges:
- Students cannot track the **types of questions asked** in past interviews.  
- There is **no visibility of which companies visited** and their roles/packages.  
- Students cannot access the **experience and guidance from seniors**.  
- It is difficult to **organize preparation, applications, and interview notes** efficiently.  
- Students lack a **personal system** to manage all placement-related information in one place.

These challenges make it hard for students to **plan, prepare, and succeed in placements** effectively.

## Solution
**PlacePal** is a personal placement companion web app designed to solve these problems.  
It allows students to:
- Track **all applied companies** and their status (Applied, Interviewed, Offer, Rejected)  
- Record **personal interview notes** and preparation insights  
- Access information about **past interview questions, company trends, and role expectations**  
- Learn from **senior student experiences and guidance**  
- Analyze **placement progress and preparation trends** through dashboards and statistics  

This makes the placement journey **organized, personalized, and insightful**, giving students full control over their preparation.
